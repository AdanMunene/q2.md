i) Memory Allocation: Arrays are stored in a continuous memory block, requiring a fixed size at initialization. In contrast, linked lists use dynamic memory allocation, allowing their size to grow or shrink as needed.  

ii) Performance: Linked lists have slower element access (`O(n)`) since nodes must be traversed sequentially, whereas arrays offer faster access (`O(1)`) using direct indexing.  

iii) **Insertion and Deletion:** Arrays require shifting elements, making insertion and deletion costly (`O(n)`). Linked lists handle insertions and deletions more efficiently at the head or tail (`O(1)`) but can be slower in the middle (`O(n)`).
