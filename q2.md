i) Allocating Memory.  Arrrays require a predetermined size because they exist in a single block of memory.  The size of linked lists might fluctuate since they are dynamically allocated.

 ii) Action.  Because linked lists have delayed access (0(n)), nodes must be traversed.  Using indexing (0(n)), arrays can access elements more quickly than linked lists.

 iii) Erasure and Removal.  Because elements may need to shift periodically, arrays are expensive (0(n)).  Linked lists are slower in the center (0(n)), but more effective at the head and tail.
